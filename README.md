My final app will be a restaurant management app. The purpose of this app is to organize everything in the restaurant and make the operation run more smoothly. The plan is to include a main screen with all the tables in the restaurant. This can be used to organize the seating and the waiting list. Tapping on a table could open up the table's order and have their bill available there. The restaurant adds their menu into the app to allow it to calculate the bill and organize orders.
